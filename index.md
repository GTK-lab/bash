The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.
On most Linux systems a program called bash (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program.

Learning how to write bash script is useful in that it can save the time typing all the commands that you want to execute line by line.
