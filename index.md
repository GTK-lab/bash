The bash shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the
operating system to perform. On most Linux systems a program called bash (which stands for
Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh, written by
Steve Bourne) acts as the primary shell program.

Learning how to write bash script is useful in that it can save the time typing all the
commands that you want to execute line by line.  You can use it to automate routine tasks,
control other programs, and schedule events to run after normal working hours.
